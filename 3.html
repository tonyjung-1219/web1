  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language developed by Netscape was first used in Netscape browsers.<br>
    However, Netscape was working with European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) to deliver a standardized, international programming language based on core JavaScript.<br>
    ECMA is an international standards association for information and communication systems. <br>
    This standardized version of JavaScript, called ECMAScript, behaves the same way in all applications that support the standard. <br>
    Companies can use the open standard language to develop their implementation of JavaScript. <br>
    The first version of the ECMA standard was documented in the ECMA-262 specification.<br>
    The ECMA-262 standard is also approved by the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) as ISO-16262.</p>
